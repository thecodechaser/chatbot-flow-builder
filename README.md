# Chatbot Flow Builder

> Chatbot flow Builder is a visual conversation design tool that empowers users to create custom chatbot flows with ease. Users can add message nodes manually or via drag-and-drop, each with configurable inputs and connections. Nodes can have follow-up branches, enabling deeply nested, conditional conversations. Whether building simple greetings or complex decision trees, Chatbot flow Builder offers a flexible and intuitive interface for designing interactive chat experiences.
